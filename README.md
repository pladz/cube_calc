Small project to get cubing rates since rates for RED and BLACK cubes are finally released to the public.

Page can be found on https://pladz.github.io/cube_calc/

Assumptions:

1. Equality cubes assume that all 3 lines use the same rates as the first red cube lines
2. Hexa cubes assume that
   a) 1st line uses same rates as first red cube line
   b) 2nd line uses same rates as second red cube line
   c) 3rd-6th lines use same rates as third red cube line

All rates in this simulation are taken from KMS rates

Update 17/5/21,

Fixed three line boss appearing, added multiple stats to select for

As of 15/5/21,

This simulation can:

1. Give you the percentage chance to roll above a certain value for any given stat (Fill in Type and >=X%)
   a) Type is the stat you want to roll
   b) >=X% is a number where you want to roll equal to or above that stat (generally 21%/27% and so on...)
   c) Works for WSE as well, Boss Dmg, IED, etc.

2. Give you the percentage to roll a specific line in that specific order
